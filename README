SMBIOS kernel module project
=============================

This project has the goal to make the SM-BIOS data visible in a human readable
format. Almost every computer with a BIOS does also provide System Management
BIOS data not there does not seem to exist a tool to easily read the management
information provided here in.

The System Management BIOS specifiaction is a standard provided by the DMTF
(distributed management task force, inc.) and available at
http://dmtf.org/standards/bios.php.

The smbios kernel module reads the SMBIOS management information and makes it
visible in three different formats:
1. /proc/smbios: the file names match the names of the SMBIOS types and the
files contain the interpreted (cooked) information of the corresponding type
2. /proc/smbios/raw:  the file names match the SMBIOS types and the contents
are in raw (binary) format, so any application can interpret the types on their
own
3. /proc/smbios/cooked: the file names match the SMBIOS types and the files
contain the interpreted (cooked) information of the corresponding type.

Currently, the cooked information does not yet cover each SMBIOS type nor does
it cover each entry in the SMBIOS types. This is subject to be done in the
future. The supported SMBIOS reference specification version is 2.3.1.

For installation instructions, please look at the INSTALL file.

The most useful stuff is already supported but there's still a lot to do.
Any help is appreciated, be it development support, reporting of bugs (or
patches) or simply by saying that you like it ;-)

Have fun,
Thomas
