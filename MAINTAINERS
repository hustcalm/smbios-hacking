 		-----------------------------------

Maintainers List (try to look for most precise areas first)

Note: For the hard of thinking, this list is meant to remain in alphabetical
order. 

P: Person

L: Mailing list that is relevant to this area
W: Web-page with status/info
S: Status, one of the following:

	Supported:	Someone is actually paid to look after this.
	Maintained:	Someone actually looks after it.
	Odd Fixes:	It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
			much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
	Orphan:		No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the 
			role as you write your new code].
	Obsolete:	Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
			it has been replaced by a better system and you
			should be using that.
