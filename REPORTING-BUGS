     What follows is a suggested procedure for reporting bugs. You
aren't obliged to use the bug reporting format, it is provided as a guide
to the kind of information that can be useful to developers - no more.

This is a suggested format for a bug report sent to the Linux kernel mailing 
list. I just used it here for a common handling. Having a standardized bug 
report form makes it easier  for you not to overlook things, and easier for 
the developers to find the pieces of information they're really interested in. 
Don't feel you have to follow it.

   First run the ver_linux script included as scripts/ver_linux or
at <URL:ftp://ftp.sai.msu.su/pub/Linux/ver_linux> It checks out
the version of some important subsystems.  Run it with the command
"sh scripts/ver_linux"

[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
[7.] Environment
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
[7.2.] Processor information (from /proc/cpuinfo):
[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):
[7.4.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi)
[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
       (please look in /proc and include all information that you
       think to be relevant):
[X.] Other notes, patches, fixes, workarounds:


Thank you
